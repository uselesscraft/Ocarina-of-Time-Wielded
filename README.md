# Project Ocarina of Time Wielded
A project where I aim to make Ocarina of Time feel more *modern* with visual upgrades!

Unfortunately, this **ONLY** works on Windows.

Before continuing, ***HUGE THANKS*** to everyone who worked on Ship of Harkinian and its *AMAZING* mods!

# Credits

**Credits to**:

**GhostlyDark** for making OOT Reloaded

**Robbyrandom** for making Transparent/Glass hud

**Skilarbabcock** for making TP Hero of Time

# Requirements
Before getting started, make sure you have:

1. Ship of Harkinian with Ocarina of Time
2. ReShade

# Preparation
1. Download the project's ZIP file from this repository.
2. Extract the content anywhere you like.

# Setting up ReShade
1. Open ReShade.
2. Click **Browse**, then select your `Ship of Harkinian.exe` file.
3. Choose **DirectX 10/11/12**.
4. When prompted to install effects, click **Browse** (again...) and find the `Ocarina of Time Wielded` folder.
5. Select the `OOT PRESET.ini` file.
6. Click **Next** to finish the setup!

Now you've got ReShade!
You could just stop here, but why not add mods?

# Mods
1. Open the `OOT MODS folder` inside your `Ocarina of Time Wielded` folder.
2. Copy **all** of the files inside.
3. Paste them into your **Ship of Harkinian** `mods` folder.

That's it! Your **game** should be ready to play!

# Notes
If something isn't working properly, double-check:

1. You selected the right `.exe` file for ReShade.
2. Mods are placed in the right directory.

That's all, bye-bye!
